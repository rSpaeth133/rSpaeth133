- 👋 Hi, I’m @rSpaeth133
- 👀 I’m interested in game dev
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ since my university requires it as a part of the computer science degree. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a game someday (but not rn since I'm still learning in college).
- 📫 How to reach me: message me on here, I suppose.
